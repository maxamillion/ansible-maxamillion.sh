Ansible playbooks and roles for maxamillion.so

I have a machine that I use for various random tasks and I manage
it with ansible. These are the bits, posted on github because ... why not?

If these playbooks are remotely useful for others, anyone is free to 
consume and modify in accordance with the GPLv3

Using
------
Edit inventory.txt appropriately, then run `ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.txt` 

Happy hacking,
